'''
COMPUTE_EPIPOLE computes the epipole in homogenous coordinates
given matching points in two images and the fundamental matrix
Arguments:
    points1 - N points in the first image that match with points2
    points2 - N points in the second image that match with points1
    F - the Fundamental matrix such that (points1)^T * F * points2 = 0

    Both points1 and points2 are from the get_data_from_txt_file() method
Returns:
    epipole - the homogenous coordinates [x y 1] of the epipole in the image

'''
COMPUTE_MATCHING_HOMOGRAPHIES determines homographies H1 and H2 such that they
rectify a pair of images
Arguments:
    e2 - the second epipole
    F - the Fundamental matrix
    im2 - the second image
    points1 - N points in the first image that match with points2
    points2 - N points in the second image that match with points1
Returns:
    H1 - the homography associated with the first image
    H2 - the homography associated with the second image
