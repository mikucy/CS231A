    # Define Matrix M and Vectors a,b,c in Python with NumPy

    M, a, b, c = None, None, None, None

    # ===== Problem 2b =====
    # Find the dot product of vectors a and b, save the value to aDotb

    aDotb = None

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE

    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2c =====
    # Find the element-wise product of a and b

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE

    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2d =====
    # Find (a^T b)Ma

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE

    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2e =====
    # Without using a loop, multiply each row of M element-wise by a.
    # Hint: The function repmat() may come in handy.

    # BEGIN YOUR CODE HERE

    # END YOUR CODE HERE

    # ===== Problem 2f =====
    # Without using a loop, sort all of the values 
    # of M in increasing order and plot them.
    # Note we want you to use newM from e.
